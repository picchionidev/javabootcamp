# 🏥 Medical Management System

This is a Java-based system for managing medical data, including:

- Pacients (Patients)
- Doctors
- Employees

The program allows you to register and list all records for each category using a console menu.

## 📚 About the Project

This project was developed for educational purposes as part of my learning journey in Java. It covers key concepts such as:

- Abstract classes and inheritance
- Method overriding
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism 
- Object-oriented programming
- ArrayLists and dynamic data storage
> (I utilized polymorphism in my project, but I chose not to use a single list for all objects in order to keep the lists separate and maintain a clean/organized structure) 

> 🧠 **Note:** All class and menu content is written in English to help improve my English skills while coding.✍️
