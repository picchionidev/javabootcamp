iPhone Simulation Project 📱
This project simulates the core functionalities of an iPhone, such as a Music Player 🎵, Phone 📞, and Web Browser 🌐. It was created to demonstrate my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in Java, while also helping me practice and improve my English skills 🇬🇧.

Features:

Music Player 🎶: Play, pause, and select songs.

Phone 📱: Call, answer calls, and start voicemail.

Web Browser 🌍: Display pages, open new tabs, and refresh pages.

Why English? 🗣️

I chose to develop this project using English for the following reasons:

Language Practice: English is essential in the programming world. By coding in English, I improve my technical vocabulary and communication skills.

Consistency: Most programming languages, libraries, and frameworks use English for keywords, functions, and documentation.

Global Reach: Using English makes the project accessible to a wider audience, including developers from different countries.
