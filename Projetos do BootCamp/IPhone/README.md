# iPhone Simulation Project 📱

This project simulates the core functionalities of an iPhone, such as a Music Player 🎵, Phone 📞, and Web Browser 🌐. It was created to demonstrate my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in Java, while also helping me practice and improve my English skills.

## Features:

### 🎶 Music Player
- Play, pause, and select songs.

### 📱 Phone
- Make calls, answer calls, and start voicemail.

### 🌍 Web Browser
- Display pages, open new tabs, and refresh pages.

## Why English? 🗣️

I chose to develop this project using English for the following reasons:

- **Language Practice**: English is essential in the programming world. By coding in English, I improve my technical vocabulary and communication skills.
- **Consistency**: Most programming languages, libraries, and frameworks use English for keywords, functions, and documentation.
- **Global Reach**: Using English makes the project accessible to a wider audience, including developers from different countries.

## Learning Goal with this Project

- **Interface Implementation**: I used **interfaces** to model the different functionalities of the iPhone. Each feature (Music Player, Phone, and Web Browser) has its own interface, which is then implemented by the `Iphone` class.

## Interfaces and Classes

### Interfaces

#### 1. **MusicPlayer Interface**
Define methods for controlling music playback on the iPhone, such as playing, pausing, and selecting a song.

#### 2. **Phone Interface**
Defines methods for making and receiving calls, including dialing a number, answering calls, and accessing voicemail.

#### 3. **WebBrowser Interface**
Defines methods for browsing the web, such as displaying a webpage, opening a new tab, and refreshing the current page.

### `Iphone` Class

The `Iphone` class implements all three interfaces: `MusicPlayer`, `Phone`, and `WebBrowser`. It provides the actual behavior for each of the functionalities defined in the interfaces, allowing the iPhone to simulate music control, phone calls, and web browsing.
